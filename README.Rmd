# mapspamc_mwi

This repository contains the scripts to create crop distribution maps with the [`mapspamc`](https://github.com/michielvandijk/mapspamc) R package for Ethiopia, covering the year 2015. To run the scripts, the user needs to install `mapspamc` and download the [mapspamc database](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7031917), which includes all the required input data, including subnational crop statistics for Malawi as well as global maps. Note that the (subnational) statistics were modified for illustrative purposes. Please use the latest version of the SPAM database  [@Yu2020] when presenting crop distribution maps for Ethiopia.

Detailed information on how to install the package and run the Ethiopia case-study is provided in the articles of the `mapspamc` [package website](https://michielvandijk.github.io/mapspamc/). Additional information is available in a scientific journal article [@VanDijk2022b]. Please cite this article if you use the `mapspamc`package.
